### Programming Languages
<br>C++</br>: I am currently learning C++ and have been enjoying every bit of it so far. Currently my favourite programming language to learn and use.
<br>Javascript</br>: I have been learning Javascript for a little bit over a year and have used it for web development and a little bit of game development aswell.
<br>Python</br>: Experimented with Python for only about a month and it was pretty fun.
<br>LuaU</br>: Been exploiting on Roblox for over 6 years and I have always been fascinated with Roblox scripts. LuaU was one of the primary things that sparked with interest with programming and reverse engineering.
